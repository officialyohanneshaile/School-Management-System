# School-Management-System
School Management System is a program that lets you create account as either a school registrar (or an admin as we labeled it there) or a teacher. 
With your particular account info, you can sign in and manage a school according to your user previelage. 

1. If you are a registrar, you can register new students and see the list of students in any of the grades and sections in the school you manage.
2. If you are a teacher,  you can grade your students, see their list and also roster.

The software was developed in Java, and it has a relational database written in SQL. My friends and I used Apache NetBeans to design and develop the forms. MySQL Workbench was the
working area of the School Management Databse SQL script.
